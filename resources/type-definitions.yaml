# Yaml-based format to define types in Release, as an alternative to synthetic.xml
# This format is in Tech Preview in Release 23.1 and may change in future versions.
#
# You can also use synthetic.xml to define types. Note that contents of the two files
# are merged. This means that you can't have the same type definition in both
# type-definitions.yaml and synthetic.xml at the same time.
